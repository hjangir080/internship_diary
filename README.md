# Internship Diary

This repository contains my Internship Diary project, created using [Mesop](https://google.github.io/mesop/). The diary includes daily reports, weekly reports, and a chatbot that can access these reports and provide responses using OpenAI's chat completion. The website is deployed and accessible at [my-internship-diary.onrender.com](https://my-internship-diary.onrender.com).

## Features

- **Daily Reports**: Document your daily activities and tasks.
- **Weekly Reports**: Summarize your weekly progress and accomplishments.
- **Chatbot Integration**: An AI-powered chatbot that can access and respond to queries based on your reports.

## Technologies Used

- **Mesop**: A framework for creating interactive documents.
- **OpenAI**: For chat completion and AI responses.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For front-end development.
