### Weekly Internship Summary

#### Week 2 (10/06/2024 - 14/06/2024)
The second week was focused on advancing projects, learning new tools, and overcoming technical challenges. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive summary of the week:

- **Word Embeddings Study (Day 6):**
  - Explored various word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, and ELMo, understanding their role in deducing relations and context.
  - Began planning a sea route optimization project using Dijkstra or A* algorithms and CrewAI agents.

- **Route Optimization Project (

Day 7):**
  - Used GeoPandas for data reading and integrated CrewAI agents, tasks, and tools.
  - Encountered challenges with data processing due to RAM limitations when creating a graph using NetworkX.

- **Graph Creation and Pathfinding (Day 8):**
  - Successfully created a graph using NetworkX and found a path, although the entire dataset could not be processed.
  - Explored the Assistant API.

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration (Day 9):**
  - Ensured all tools work together properly but faced challenges with multi-agent collaboration.

- **Agent Collaboration and New Tools (Day 10):**
  - Resolved agent collaboration issues and ensured the program can access all tools, tasks, and agents properly.
  - Encountered and began addressing an issue with input parsing and passing.
  - Explored the Assistant's Playground on the OpenAI platform.

### Challenges Faced in Week 2
- **Data Processing Limits:** Encountered significant challenges with data processing limits due to the RAM being completely used up when creating a graph using NetworkX from a very large dataset.
- **Agent Collaboration Issues:** Initially faced difficulties in establishing effective multi-agent collaboration where the agents did not respond well when called through the multi-agent system. This was later resolved.
- **Input Parsing Problems:** After resolving collaboration issues, encountered problems with how the input is being parsed and passed along within the program.
- **Optimization Project Complexity:** The sea route optimization project required detailed planning and integration of multiple tools, leading to challenges in execution due to data processing constraints.
