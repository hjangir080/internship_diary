### Internship Diary

#### Day 1 - 03/06/2024
On my first day, I delved into several new technologies and tools, setting a strong foundation for the rest of my internship. Hereâ€™s a detailed account of what I accomplished:

- **MongoDB Introduction and Setup:**
  - **Learning MongoDB:** I began by learning the basics of MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database.
  - **Setting Up MongoDB Compass:** Installed and configured MongoDB Compass, a graphical user interface for MongoDB.
  - **Python Integration with PyMongo:** Connected MongoDB with Python using the PyMongo library.
  - **CRUD Operations:** Performed CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database using Python.
  - **Dataframe Display:** Displayed the database contents in dataframes for better visualization and manipulation.

- **Docker Exploration:**
  - **Learning Docker:** Gained an understanding of Docker, a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.
  - **Installing Docker:** Successfully installed Docker on my machine.
  - **Creating and Hosting Docker Images:** Created a Docker image from a repository and hosted it, facilitating easier deployment and management of applications.

- **AI Tools and Concepts:**
  - **AI Studios and GPTs:** Briefly explored various AI studios and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, including:
    - Mistral AI
    - Groq AI
    - Google AI Studio
  - **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Introduced to RAG, a technique combining retrieval and generation for improved performance in AI models.
  - **Word2Vec:** Learned about Word2Vec, a method for generating word embeddings that capture semantic meanings of words.
